# Aureeq - AI Sales Restaurant Agent

Aureeq is an intelligent, voice-activated AI sales assistant designed for **IYI Restaurant**. It combines a 3D avatar frontend with a powerful local LLM backend to engage customers, answer menu queries, and upsell items using professional sales strategies.

## Project Structure

- **frontend/**: A modern web interface featuring a 3D VRM avatar (Three.js), speech recognition, and lip-sync capabilities. Built with Vite.
- **model_training/**: The Python backend (FastAPI) that powers the AI. It uses:
  - **Ollama (Llama 3)** for intelligence.
  - **ChromaDB** for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to access the menu and sales examples.
  - **Edge TTS** for voice synthesis.
- **data/**: Contains menu data, voice samples, and vector store artifacts.

## 🐳 One-Click Docker Deployment (Recommended)

This project is fully containerized. You can deploy it on any machine with Docker installed.

*App will be available at http://aureeq.kamsoft.tech*

### 2. Download AI Models (First-Time Only)
The AI engine (Ollama) is integrated. Wait ~15 seconds for the service to start, then run these commands once to download the brains:
```bash
# Download the LLM
docker exec -it ollama ollama pull llama3.2:3b

# Download the Embeddings model
docker exec -it ollama ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

### 3. VPS Tips (Standard Port 80)
The app is configured to listen on **Port 80**. Ensure your VPS firewall allows HTTP traffic.
